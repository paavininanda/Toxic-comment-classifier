""This app takes design to a whole new level of interactivity"" - Design News

Build any circuit, tap play button, and watch dynamic voltage, current, and charge animations. This gives you insight into circuit operation like no equation does. While simulation is running, adjust circuit parameters with analog knob, and the circuit responds to your actions in real time. You can even generate an arbitrary input signal with your finger!

That's interactivity and innovation you can't find in best SPICE tools for PC like Multisim, LTspice, OrCad or PSpice (trademarks belong to their respective owners).

EveryCircuit is not just an eye candy. Under the hood it packs custom-built simulation engine optimized for interactive mobile use, serious numerical methods, and realistic device models. In short, Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, nonlinear semiconductor device equations, and all the good stuff is there.

Growing library of components gives you freedom to design any analog or digital circuit from a simple voltage divider to transistor-level masterpiece.

Schematic editor features automatic wire routing, and minimalistic user interface. No nonsense, less tapping, more productivity.

Simplicity, innovation, and power, combined with mobility, make EveryCircuit a must-have companion for high school science and physics students, electrical engineering college students, breadboard and printed circuit board (PCB) enthusiasts, and ham radio hobbyists.

Create an account to unlock the full functionality for a limited time. The full version will employ all of your imagination, and all the screen area of your tablet. Join EveryCircuit cloud community to store your circuits on cloud, access them from any of your devices, explore public community circuits and share your own designs.

Children snap together graphical programming blocks to make characters move, jump, dance, and sing. Children can modify characters in the paint editor, add their own voices and sounds, even insert photos of themselves -- then use the programming blocks to make their characters come to life.

ScratchJr was inspired by the popular Scratch programming language (http://scratch.mit.edu), used by millions of young people (ages 8 and up) around the world. In creating ScratchJr, we redesigned the interface and programming language to make them developmentally appropriate for younger children, carefully designing features to match young children's cognitive, personal, social, and emotional development.

We see coding (or computer programming) as a new type of literacy. Just as writing helps you organize your thinking and express your ideas, the same is true for coding. In the past, coding was seen as too difficult for most people. But we think coding should be for everyone, just like writing.

As young children code with ScratchJr, they learn how to create and express themselves with the computer, not just to interact with it. In the process, children learn to solve problems and design projects, and they develop sequencing skills that are foundational for later academic success. They also use math and language in a meaningful and motivating context, supporting the development of early-childhood numeracy and literacy. With ScratchJr, children aren't just learning to code, they are coding to learn.

ScratchJr is a collaboration between the Developmental Technologies group at Tufts University, the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab, and the Playful Invention Company. Two Sigma led the implementation of the Android version of ScratchJr. The graphics and illustrations for ScratchJr were created by HvingtQuatre Company and Sarah Thomson.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So
 here's the deal: everybody can learn to code. The problem is that
today's university-first approach is a bit old school, and frankly, out
of touch. That's why Grasshopper offers a new kind of curriculum for the
 everyday coder. In particular, Grasshopper:

* Fits in your
pocket, and your lifestyle. You don't need a fancy laptop or a lecture
hall to write code. You've already got a supercomputer in your pocket!
So fire up your smartphone, and start coding during that commercial
break, or your evening commute.
* Focuses on doing, not just reading.
 The best way to learn to code is to actually write code. That's why
Grasshopper goes straight to coding real stuff, not watching hours of
videos or learning syntax. You're writing real JavaScript from the very
first lesson.
* Finds the approach that fits you best. One size
doesn't fit all. Not when it comes to pants (even the stretchy ones),
and definitely not when it comes to coding. So Grasshopper lets you
explore different lessons, and provides just-in-time feedback to guide
you along the way.

What some of our students are saying:

""Tasks were small and easy to do while chilling out or on a commute!"" - Jane, 21

""I
 like how Include helps you learn one step at a time. It's not
overwhelming for someone who’s just starting to learn."" - Ankit, 29

""I
 enjoyed breaking it down into small building blocks, and being able to
get satisfaction from building something early."" - Claire
